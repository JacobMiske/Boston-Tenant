      The BTC was formed in 1995 in the aftermath of the end of rent control. 
      Many of the founding organizations worked together before 1995 to secure 
      several important tenant policy changes, including stopping the City from 
      shutting off tenantsâ€™ water when landlords did not pay their bills, pushing 
      banks and government institutions like the Resolution Trust Corporation to 
      dispose of foreclosed property for affordable housing, and reforming the 
      City Inspection Services Department. Since 1995, the BTC has been strengthening 
      the tenant movement by organizing tenant leaders across constituencies (private, 
      public, and subsidized housing, seniors and disabled) to articulate and publicize 
      a tenant agenda, and by expanding statewide coalition efforts to protect and
      expand tenant rights, increase support for low-income housing, and defeat real 
      estate industry attempts to erode tenant rights. We are currently in our eighth 
      year of the 10,000 Affordable Homes campaign, whose main goal is the creation of 
      10,000 units of permanently affordable housing. We are also working in coalition 
      with others on creating new policy against the displacement of tenants and owners 
      due to foreclosure and trying to capture foreclosed units for affordable housing.
